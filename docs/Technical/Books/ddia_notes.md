## Section I: Foundations of Data Systems
#### Dicussing the fundamental ideas that underpin the design of data-intensive applications

### Preface

We call an application **data-intensive** if data is its primary challenge--the equantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing--as opposed to __compute-intensive__, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck

New types of database systems ("NoSQL") have been getting lots of attention, but message queues, caches, search indexes, frameworks for batch and stream processing, and related technologies are very important too. Many applications use some combination of these

If any of the following are true for you, you'll find this book valuable:
- You want to learn how to make data systems scalable, for example, to support web or mobile apps with millions of users
- You need to make applications highly available (minimizing downtime) and operationally robust
- You are looking for ways of making systems easier to maintain in the long run, even as they grow and as requirements and technologies change
- You have a natural curiosity for the way things work and want to know what goes on inside major websites and online services. This book breaks down the internals of various databases and data processing systems, and it’s great fun to explore the bright thinking that went into their design.

There is truth in that statement: building for scale that you don’t need is wasted effort and may lock you into an inflexible design. In effect, it is a form of premature optimization. However, it’s also important to choose the right tool for the job, and different technologies each have their own strengths and weaknesses. As we shall see, relational databases are important but not the final word on dealing with data.

### Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable & Maintainable Applications
#### Introduces the terminology and approach that we’re going to use throughout this book. It examines what we actually mean by words like reliability, scalability, and maintainability, and how we can try to achieve these goals.

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality. 
For example, many applications need to:

1. Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
2. Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
3. Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
4. Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing)
5. Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing) 


### Chapter 2 - Data Models & Query Languages
#### Compares several different data models and query languages—the most visible distinguishing factor between databases from a developer’s point of view. We will see how different models are appropriate to different situations.



### Chapter 3 - Storage & Retrieval
#### This chapter turns to the internals of storage engines and looks at how databases lay out data on disk. Different storage engines are optimized for different workloads, and choosing the right one can have a huge effect on performance.

### Chapter 4 - Encoding & Evolution
#### Here we compare various formats for data encoding (serialization) and especially examine how they fare in an environment where application requirements change and schemas need to adapt over time.


### Section II: Distributed Data
#### Data distrubuted across multiple machines and the challenges associated with distributed data

### Chapter 5 - Replication 

### Chapter 6 - Partitioning & Sharding

### Chapter 7 - Transactions

### Chapter 8 - The Trouble with Distributed Systems

### Chapter 9 - Consistency & Consensus

### Setion III: Derived Data
#### When there is no one database that can do everything well, applications need to integrate several different databases, caches, indexes and so on

### Chapter 10 - Batch Processing

### Chapter 11 - Stream Processing

### Chapter 12 - The Future of Data Systems
